                Scenic beauty, a moderate climate, a culture rich in history and the arts, and 
                world-class sports and recreational opportunities make North Carolina an exceptional 
                place to live and do business. Combine that with quality health care, 
                top universities, a low cost of living, and it's easy to see 
                why most people who live here never want to leave.

                North Carolina is proud to have been the first in the nation to 
                address learning standards, student tests and school accountability 
                simultaneously. North Carolina boasts 53 colleges and universities, including 
                17 public universities, as well as a robust community college system.
